Webtrees
--------

[Webtrees](https://webtrees.net/) is an online collaborative genealogy application. It started life as [PhpGedView](http://webtrees.net/index.php/en/) but PGV has since had limited development. Webtrees was born as a fork of PGV after issues regarding using SourceForge arose.

Installation
------------

Download all files into `modules_v4/GVExport` directory and enable the plugin via modules administration page.

GraphViz
--------

The ouptut format of the module is known as DOT and is used by [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) which is a general pupose graphing tool. If GraphViz is installed on the server the module can use it to generate image files directly.

GVExport Module
---------------

The original [GVExport Module](http://wiki.phpgedview.net/en/index.php?title=GVExport_module) appears on the PhpGedView Wiki but the developer states he hasn't worked on the module in over two years and doesn't plan to any further.
